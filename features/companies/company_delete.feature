Feature: Deleting companies
  As an admin
  I want to be able to delete a company

  #Scenario: Delete a company by an authenticated user
  #  Given I exist as a user
  #  And I am logged in
  #  And there is a company listed
  #  And I am on the homepage
  #  When I follow the company
  #  And I follow the delete link
  #  Then I should see a successful delete message
  #  And I should not see the deleted company

  #Scenario: Delete a company when not logged in
  #  Given I exist as a user
  #  And I am not logged in
  #  And there is a company listed
  #  And I am on the homepage
  #  And I follow the company
  #  Then I should not see the delete link
